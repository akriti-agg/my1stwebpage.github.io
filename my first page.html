     <h3>Pineapple</h3>
     <p>Pineapples are tropical fruits that are rich in vitamins, enzymes and antioxidants. They may help boost the immune system, build strong bones and aid indigestion. And, despite their sweetness, pineapples are low in calories.<br>
To make your pineapple softer and juicier, keep it at room temperature for 1 or 2 days before cutting.One cup of pineapple has 70 to 85 calories. I like to eat pineapples a lot.</p>
